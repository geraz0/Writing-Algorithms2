# Java Algorithm Implementations

## About
This repository contains Java implementations of several popular sorting and searching algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Java class with main methods for easy execution and testing.

## Algorithms Included
- **Bubble Sort**: Demonstrates the bubble sort technique on arrays of integers.
- **Quick Sort**: Implements the quick sort algorithm using a recursive approach.
- **Counting Sort**: Used for sorting strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
- **Z-Algorithm**: Applies the Z-algorithm for pattern matching to find occurrences of a substring within a string.
